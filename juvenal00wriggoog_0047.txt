xxxviii INTRODUCTION

(d) The diaeresis at the end of the fourth foot, called ⁸
the bucolic caesura, is more common in Juvenal than 1n
any other Latin poet. It rs usually accompanied by the
penthemimeral caesura3 a's

3. 212 si magna Asturici Η cecidit domus ΙΙ horrida mater.

J 81. smilion is frequent, but never occurs at the end of
'the verse. ⁸

Long vowels and diphthongs are often elided.· Monosyllables very
rarely suffer elisi0n; as 3. 2¹5³ 559· 10 75 ²¹7 In rr. 161 there
are five cases of elision‚ and verses with two 3ηά three elided syllables
are not infrequent '

89. fflbtus rs allowed m elenen undisputedcases,- always
at the principal caesura

The hiatus occurs once atter the second thesis, seven times after
the third, and three times after the fourth3 as

12. 36 testiculi; adeo medicatum intellegit' inguen.
3. 70 hic Andro, ille Samo, hic Trallibus aut Alabandis.
5. 158 quis melior plorante gula? ergo omnia fiunt

83. Spondaic Verres. There are thirty-three spondaic lines in
Juvenal. One (5. 38) closes with three spondees3 in all the others
the fourth foot is a dactyl. One (3.·273)‘ ends witha monosyllable‚
and fifteen witha trisyllable. In seventeen the fifth 3ηά sixth feet are
contained in a quadrisyllable.

PROSODY

84. Ηηαί Syllobles. Final i of milri, tibi, sibi is 'long only
when the ictus falls upon it. The same is true of final o
of verbs and adverbS, and ol substantives of the third
declension. ¹

Ergo (3. 281) is an exception. Final o is made short in efflando
(3. ²32l· Final i of ubi and ibi is short in the simple words, but long iu ’
the compounds ubique and ibidem.

, 85. Genitives in ius· The vowel -ἱ ot alterius is by
necessity short in dactylic verse. In other vgenitives in ius,
excepting illius 6. 608, it is always long.
