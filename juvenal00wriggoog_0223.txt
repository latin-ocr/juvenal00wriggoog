199. Spartano cuidam: the
story of Glaucus is found in Herod-
otus VI. 86. Α certain Milesian,
having heard of the reputation of
Glaucus for honesty‚ changed half
of his estate into silver, and de·
posited it with him, where he felt
certain that it would be secure.
Years after his sons caure to claim
the money. Glaucus pretended ¹
that he had no recollection of any
deposh, but requested them to
come to him again in four months.
Meanwhilehe went to Delphi. and
inquired 01 the oracle whether he
should not persist in his denial.
lle was told that the entire family
01 the perjurer would be destroyed.
lle sent, therefore, for the sons
01 the Milesian, and restored the
money. but three generations later
not a single descendant of Glaucus
was left in Sparta.
