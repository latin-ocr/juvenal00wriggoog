Thersites in qua se traducebat Vlixes ; ·

18. oppositis, pawned, mort-
gaged ,· cf. Cat. 26 villula opposita
od milia quindecim et ducentos.—
fracta: he breaks an image of .
his mother that it may not be rec·
ognized‚ and then sells it for old
silver.

19. nummis: i.e. sestertiis.—

20.' fictile : cf. 3. 168fictilibus ce-
name; he has pawned his silver
and must eat from earthenware.—
miscellanea‚ lzotchpotch the nour-
ishing but coarse fare of the gladi-
atorial school (ludus gladiatorius).

21. ergo: as l have already
said; cf. vss. 1-2.

22. laudabile nomen : eg. lihe-
ralitas. 'l'he subject of est and
the two verbs following is to be
found in haec eadem paret; liv-
ing in such style is extravagance in
a Rutilus, but in a Ventidius it is
called by a better-sounding name;
cf. 4. 13 and 8. 182.

clause, hence the indicative. The

subjunctive ignoret gives the con·
dition of despiciam.

is the large strong box which holds
the money of the rich-e caelo
descendit: ie. it was, at any rate.
of divine origin—yvddt σεαυτόνε
an inscription at Delphi, ascribed
to many different sources. Juvenal
extends it beyond the nosce uni·
rreum tuum of Cicero Tusa Ι. 52,
and makes it include the measure
of one's abilities and resources;
vs. 35.

29. coniugium: ie. that you
may wed one of your station.—
in parte senatus : seek only those
offices which you ate able to fill.
