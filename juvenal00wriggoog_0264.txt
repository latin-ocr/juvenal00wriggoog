XVI. Ort Tur: onnwrnons os
A Mrsrvnnv usn—The satire is
incomplete; the plan proposed in·
vs. 7 is not iulfilled, and the whole
ends abruptly (vs. 6ο) with an
unfinished sentence. It is more
<likely that it was written by Juve-
nal than by an imitator.¹ The
thought and style are not unwor-
thy ot the poet. Moreover, vs. 2
is quoted by Priscian (VIII. 31
and 82), and vss. 6 and 4² by Ser-
vius (on Aen. Ι. 16, and 11.102)
as from Juvenal.

, 1-6.4 Yon can hardly enumerate
the rewards that fall to the soldier
who is favored by fortune.

1. felicis militiae‚oflucky mr'li-
tary service. — Galli: unknown3
cf.14.1n.

2. narn si: the emphasis is
on felicis and prospera. I say
‘lucky’ ior if 1 could be sure of
joining a lucky regimem, would

recruit; narnis found in all Mss,
but Priscian, who twice quotes this

cf. 7. 194 distat enim quae sidera te
excelsiam.

= 4. ,plus valet: luel< does more
ior the soldier than the favor of
Mars, though gained through the
influente oi Venus, his mistress,
and Juno, his mother.

tus (Ill. 60) says the Heraeum at
Samos was the largest temple
which he had seen.

7-34. If you are a soldier, no
civilian dares injure you, or even
resent it ii you injure him.

7. commoda communia, tlte
advantages that are shared alt'ke by·
all soldiers. As no advantages are
afterwards mentioned that are not
common to all, it is evident that.
the satire is incomplete.

8. ne: a purpose is implied,
This advantage is considered as
a motive for entering the service.
-togatus, a civilian, opposed to
asoldier; cf. paganum vs. 33.

9. nec audeat: he dares not
make complaint before the prae-

centurion who will hear the case
in camp, and, under these circum·
