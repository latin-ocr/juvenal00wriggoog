15. Naturally, then, Juvenal has respect for the old
national faith and hates all foreign religions. He treats
with derision the Greek fables that represent the gods
in human form, with human necessities and weaknesses
(13. 39-52‚ 833 14. 261, 2713 16. 5), and considersthe Greek
stories about the under-world too absurd even for children
to believe (2. 149-152). The Jewish worship, with its sab·
baths and prayer to an unseen god, he regards as a narrow-

minded fore-ign superstition (14. 96-106). But he speaks
with respect of a common creator (15. 148) and offers sacri-
fices to Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva, as well as to his own
LareS, for the safe’return of his friend Catullus (12. 8 3-92).
He says with evident sincerity that man is dearer to. the gods

than he is to himself (10. 350), that the gods have given
him a reverential spirit (15.143) 1ηά have placed in his
breast a conscience to scourge him when he does wrong
(13. 192-198). He believes that the gods will avenge per·
jury and crime (13. 247-249)‚ and affirms that he who
cherishes even the wish to sin incurs the guilt of the deed
and will not escape punishment (13. 208-210). ,

16. Juvenal did not profess to have much acquaintance
with the philosophy of the schools (13. rao-123), but he
knew their main distinctions and his sympathieswere with
the §toics rather than the Epicureans. Like the Stoics, he
believed in the unehangeable decrees of fate (7. 200 ; 12. 63)
and the providential care of the gods ( 10. 347), and like
them he commended the endurance of hardship for its own
sake and a contempt of death ( 10. 357-362). But, in gen·
eral, for him philosophy is simply the highest wisdom, which
shows man how to live. lt frees us from our errors and
teaches us what is right (13. 187-189), enables us to conquer
misfortune (13. 10), forbids revenge (13. 184-187), and is
