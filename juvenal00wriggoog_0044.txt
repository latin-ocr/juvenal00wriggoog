have lost their diminutive signification, and hardly differ in meaning
from the primitives from which they were formed; as 3. 161 sarcinulae
(ί the wife's fortune ') = sarcinae, which is used in the same sense in
Martial 11. 11.8; 10. 82 fornacula (to which the adjective magna is
j0ined) :fornax; 1. 160 labellum = labrum 3. 28 bacillum = baculum.

(b) In a few cases the diminutive has come to have a special mean-
ing which the primitive does not have; as 1·95 sportula (‘ dole ⁹)
from sporta, ‘basket'; 8.5 auricula (the external ear) from auris,
the organ of hearing; 10.134 buccula (cheekpiece of a helmet) from
bucca, ‘cheeln’
