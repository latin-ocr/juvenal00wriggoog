tragedy. Agave tore in pieces her
son Pentheus. king of Thebes,
when he attempted to keep the
Theban women from celebrating
the festival of Bacchus.

88. ille: ie. Paris. There were
several actors of this name. The
one here mentioned lived under
Domitian and suffered death in 8 3
by order of the emperor on ac-
count of his intimacy with the em-
press. Martial composed his epi-
taph (xl. 13), from which it
appears that he carne from Egypt
(sales ⁴lili), and was a great
favorite with the people.

89. semestri auro: ie. the
ring gained by six months’ service
as tribune. l'oung rnen of noble
families were not infrequently ap
pointed tribunes for six months
only; cf. Plin. Ep. IV. 42 liurte
rogo semestri tribunatu splendidis
rem facias. The tribune had the
right to wear the gold ring of the
equites, and this privilege as well
as the equestrian rank was re-
tained after the period of service
hadexpired.

90. quod non dant: ie. posi·
tions in the army. An actor has
more influence with the emperor
than the nobles have- Cameri-
nos: the Camerini (3. 38) and the

Bareae (3. r 16) were noble families;

94. Proculeius : brother of Te·
rentia, the wife of Maecenas. He
was liberal in the treatment of his
own family (Hor. C. 11. 2. 5-8) and
may have been a patron of litera·
ture. See Intr.·79c.

95. Fabius, Cotta: patrous of
Ovid- Lentulus: there is no
other mention of any patron of
literature of this name.

96. tunc: ie. when there were
such patrous of literature. When
talent was rewarded, it was of some
advantage to poets to grow pale
from much study (pallere), and to
abstain from the dissipations of
the Saturnalia. This festival be
gan December 17, ¹and lasted five
days (Mart. IV. 88. 2 et iam
Saturni quinque suere dies). and
sometimes seven (Mart. XIV. 72
Saturni septem dt'es), but its spirit
affected the whole month.
