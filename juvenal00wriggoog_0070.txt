Quamvis digressu veteris confusus amici,

laudo tamen, vacuis quod sedem figere Cumis

destinet atque unum civem donare Sibyllae.

dtrperator4. 293 10. 138 ; defendier
15.157;face5. 112.

171. Flaminia: cf. vs. 6111.-
Latina: 5. 55, this road separated
from the Via Appia not far
from the Porta Capena, and re-
joined it at Casilinum. By the
laws of the Twelve Tables the
dead could not be buried or burned
within the walls; Cic. Leg. II. 58
hominem mortuom in urbe ue sepc-
lito neve urite. Tombs were built
along theffnost frequented roads
near the city.

III. On Romu- Umbricius,
an old friend of Juvenal, is repre-
sented as setting out with his house·
hold for Cumae. At the gate he
halts to 'talk a while with Juve-
nal, and, to justify his abandon-
ment of his native city,he describes
the disadvantages and dangers of
Rome, in which an honest man
cannot prosper, and 0 poor man
cannot live in safety. This satire
, was closely copied by Dr. John-
son in his satire on London.

¹·9· I commend my friend for
hisdetermination toabandon Rome
nith its dangers and vexatione.

1. confusus, troubled.—amici:
Umbricius; vs. 21.

2. vacuis: cf. 10. 102 vacuis Vlu-
bris. ComparedwithRome,Cumae

seemed almost deserted.—Cumis:
in Campania, the oldest Greek
colony 01 Italy, situated near the
coast and about four miles north
01 Baiae. Here in a cavern in the
rock dwelt the Sibyl; Verg. Aen. Ι
VI. 42 sqq.

3. unum civem: the addition
of one family will make a notice-
able increase in the population of
a town so small.

4. ianua Baiarum: travelers
from Rome pass through Cumae
just before reaching Baiae.-
amoeni secessus: genitive of
definition. Cf. Hor. Ep. 1. 1. 83
nullus in orbe sinus Bam prae-
lucet amoenis. The advantages
claimed 101 Cumae are: (1) 115
quietness (vacuis); (a) its near·
ness to Baiae, the most fashion·
able Roman watering-place (ianua
Baiarum); and (3) its delightful
situation (gratum litus). ‚

5. Prochytam: (now Procidala
small island near Cape Misenum.—
Suburae: the most crowded and
most noisy part of the city (rr.
51 ferventi Subura; Mart. XII. 18.
2 clamosa Subura) and the most
immoral. 11 occupied the valley
between the Esquiline, Viminal,
and Quirinal. In this quarter or
so'me other like it, the poor man
must live if he remains at Rome.
