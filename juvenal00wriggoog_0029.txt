18. Juvenal's literary studies included Homer, Lucilius
Vergil, Horace, Ovid, and Seneca, oi whom the satires con·
tain frequent reminiscences. In a few cases he has admitted
their expressions with slight change into his verseS,¹ though
be is by no means to be considered an imitator of the older
poets. {But between the writings oi Juvenal and Martial
there are striking resemblances3 they treat often oi the
same subjecta many personal names are common to both,
and they employ many similar words and expressions.
They were intimate friends, but Martial was¹ the earlier
writer. His epigrams were completed 3ηά published before
Juvenal had brought out his first book, and probably before
any oi the satires had been written. It seems' evident, then,
that Juvenal was so familiar with the writings oi Martial
that his own language 3ηά thought were not infrequently
influenced by them.2 The two poets may well be read side
by side, since each iurnishes the best illustrations and par·
allels to the other.

in the library ol the medical school in Montpellier, where it

whose edition of Juvenal and Persius was published in
1585, and from him it is called pithoeanus. This MS. con·
tains the texts of both Persius 3ηά Juvenal, with notes on
the margin (scholia pithoeana). The first hand (P) belongs ἰ
to the ninth century. To this have been added correctionS, J
variants, and glosses by four different hands from the ninth J
