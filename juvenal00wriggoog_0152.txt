SATVRA VIII 105

nec galea faciem abscondit : movet ec‘ce tridentem;
postquam vibrati pendentia retia dextra

nequiquam effudit, nudum ad spectacula vultum 203
erigit et tota fugit agnoscendus harena.

credamus, tunicae de faucibus aurea cum se 7
porrigat et longo iactetur spira galero ¹

ergo ignominiam graviorem pertulit omni

vulnere cum Graccho iussus pugnare secutor.

210

Libera si dentur populo suffragia, quis tam
perditus ut dubitet Senecam praeferre Neroni?
cuius supplicio non debuit una parari
slmia nec serpens unus nec culleus unus ,

203. nec galea: the nrurmillo,
the Threx, and the secutor (vs. 210)
were fully armed with shield and
sword, and a helmet that covered
the entire face. The retiarius
wore the tunic only, and had
neither helmet nor shield. He
carried in one hand a net, and in
the other a trIdent (tridens or
fuscina, ci.2.143). In the com-
bat he tried to throw the net over
his antagonist and then dispatch
him with the trident. Failing to
entangle him in the net (neqni-
quam effudit), as he is not armed
for'a close encounter, he must
quickly retreat (fugit) and make
ready for another assault.

204. vibrata dextra, from his
right hand nzovt'ng to and fro while
he is watching for a favorable op
portunity to catch his adversary.

²05· effudit, has thrown ortt.

206. agnoscendus : he adopted
the costume of the retiarius that
he might be easily recognized.

²07· credamus, let us belnae it,
tie. that we see a nobleman tight-

ing as a mirariue-aurea: evi-
dence of wealth and rank.

208. spira : a band attached to
the net, by which it was drawn
back aiter an unsuccessful throw.
—galeroz a guard oi leather or
metal worn on the left arm and
reaching above the shoulder.

²09· ignominiam: the secutor,
who pursues the fleeing retiarius,
thinks it less disgraceful to be
vanquished by a skilllul gladiator
than to conquer an unskilled
nobleman3 cf. Sen. Prov. 3. 4
ignominiam iudicat gladiator cum
inferiore componi.

arr-230. Nero added to his
many crimes by writing poetry
and acting in tragedy.

211. suffragia : ct. ro. 77. Sen-
eca was of equestrian family and
provincial origin.

213. non una: see 3. ¹51⁰·

214· simia: the parricide was
scourged and sewed upin a leather
bag (culleus; cf. 13. 155 corio
boves) with an ape, a serpent, a
dog, and a cock, and drowned in
the sea or in a river. One such
punishment would be too little t'ox
