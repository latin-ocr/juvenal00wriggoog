alterius populi rapienda occasio cunctis

visa inimicorum primoribus ac ducibus, ne

laetum hilaremque diem, ne magnae gaudia cenae
sentirent positis ad templa et compita mensis
pervigilique t0r0, quem nocte ac luce iacentem
septimus interdum sol invenit. horrida sane
Aegyptos sed luxuria, quantum ipse notavi,

a

arbara famoso non cedit turba Canopo
dde quod et facilis victoria de madidis et

blaesis atque mero titubantibus, inde virorum

saltatus nigro tibicine, qualiacumque

unguenta et flores multaeque in fronte coronae: 5⁰
hinc ieiunum odium. sed iurgia prima sonare

incipiunt animis ardentibus; haec tuba rixae. ¹

39. alterius populi: probably
the Ombites‚ since Ombi was super
marma Copti (vs. 28), and Tentyra
was not. It appears also, from
verses 75-76‚ that the Ombites
were the people which celebrated
the lestal period, and that the Ten-
tyrites attacked them. But the
reading of vs. 7 5 is uncertain.

42. positis adcompita mensis :
cl. Mela Ι. 57 (speaking of the
Ι Egyptians) cibospalam et extra tecta
sna capiunt—compita, tae crass-
wa s.

13. pervigili: occupied all night
long; cf. 8. 158pervr'giles popinas,
and 3. 275.—toro: in. on which
the revelers reclined at the feast.

44. horrida sane Aegyptos,
Egypt is rrrrciailizea', to br sure.

45. quantum ipse notavi: the
statement in the vitae that Juvenal
was sent to Egypt is perhaps based
on this expression; Intr. rr.

46. Canopo: near Alexandria,
noted for its profligacy; r. 26 n.
It seems unnatural to contrast

Egypt with Canopus, which wasa

¹ part of Egypt. But Canopus con·

tained a larger element of for-
eigners, and, though in Egypt,
was essentially a foreign city.
Resides, Juvenal had Upper Egypt
in mind when he wrote: in profli-
gacy tae barbarian crowd does nat
fall behind notorious Canopus.

47. adde quod: cf. 14. ¹14·-
madidis: ci. 6. 297 madidum
Tarentum.

48. inde: ir. on the side of the
Ombites.

49. qualiacumque, such as they
were.

50. in fronte coronae : lntr. 33.

5¹· hinc ieiunum odium: the
Tentyrites were driven on by ha·
tred and hunger. - iurgia prima:
cf. 5. 26 iurgia proludunt.

5²· haec tuba: rlr. this insult-
ing language was the trumpet call
to a general combat; cf. 3. 288
miserae prooemia rixae. They be·
gin with angry words, blows follow,
then they light with stones 3 finally
