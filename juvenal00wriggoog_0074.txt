’ quid Romae faciam? mentiri nesci03 librum,

¹ si malus est, nequeo laudare et poscere; motus

.. quae mandat, norunt alii; me nemo ministro

fur erit, atque ideo nulli comes exe0, tamquam

mancus et exstinctae corpus non utile dextrae.

quis nunc diligitur nisi c'onscius et cui fervens

aestuat occultis animus semperque tacendis? 50
nil tibi se debere putat, nil conferet umquam,J

41. quid Rornae faciam: cf.
. Mart. 1-11. 38.-librum nequeo

48. mancus . . . dextrae, like
some crr'pple whose right hand is

laudare: ef. Mart. XII. 40. 1 reci· pulsatio useless triani—exstinc-

tas strala carmina, laudo.

- Α 4²· poscere: ste. ask for the
. loan of a copy in order to flatter
the author. - motus astrorum
ignoro: I cannot impose on the
credulous by pretendingto tell the
future by the stars.

43. promittere, to foratell, ie.
to the son who is inahurryto get
his iather's property.

44. ranarum viscera inspexi:
perhaps to get poison (1. 70), per-
haps lor purposes oi divination.

45. quae mittit: r'.e. his letters
and giits.

46. quae mandat: ie. messages
that he thinks it not saleto put in
writing.

47. nulli comes exeo: I cannot
be an accomplice in extortion, and
therefore no proconsul or pro·
praetor takes me into a province
as a comcs. Comites were the
personal stall of a provincial gov-
ernor. They were called also co-
lrors; cf. 8. 127 n. They were
selected by the governor, and a
dishonest officer would avoid hon-
est comites.

tae dextrae: gen. oi quality con·
nected by et to mancus-cor-
pus non utile : an appositive with
the implied substantive to which
mancus and exstinctae dextrae
belong; cf. 1.3 3 delator ct rapturus.

49. diligitur: ie. is treated as
ii he were highly esteemed.—
conscius, as is shown' by the iol·
louing verse, implies a knowledge
ot some secret crime, a confidant ;
Mart. VI. 50. 5 visficrr' dives, con-
scius esra-cui is perhaps a dis·
syllable here and in 7. 211, as it

, certainly is four times in Martial's

hendecasyllables (eg. l. 104. 22
scd norunt cui serviant leones), but
Juvenal seems to have had no
prejudice against spondaic verses.
—iervens aestuat: he is lever·
ishly anxious and yearns to dis·
close the secret, but is kept back
byiear; ci. r. roo-167.

51. nil tibi debere: he teels
under no special obligations to
you, since you can do him no
harrn by disclosing his secret. For
the qpantity of final i in tibi, see
Intr. 4.
