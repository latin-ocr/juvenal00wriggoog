et melior vicina seges, mercaris et hanc et

arbusta et densa montem qui canet oliva.

quorum si pretio dominus non vincitur ullo, 145
nocte boves macri lassoque famelica collo

iumenta ad virides huius mittentur aristas,

nec prius inde domum quam tota novalia saevos

in ventres abeant, ut credas falcibus actum.

dicere vix possis quam multi talia plorent 150
et quot venales iniuria fecerit agros.

sed qui sermones, quam foedae bucina famae!

‘quid nocet haec ?’ inquit ‘tunicam mihi malo lupini
quarn si me toto laudet vicinia pago

exigui ruris paucissima farra secantem.’ 155
scilicet et morbis et debilitate carebis,

¹44· arbusta, oineyards in
which the vines were trained on
trees—qui canet oliva: the
leaves oi the olive are grayish·
green on the upper side, and
hoary on the under side.

143· quorum: introducing an
adversative sentence: But tf their
owner cannot be induced to sell‚
you proceed to injure his property,
that it may seem to him less de·
sirable. l'our cattle get into his
field at night. They are lean
(macri), hall starred (famelica),

¹and weary from the day's work
(lasso), and therefore so ravenous
(saevos) that they leave nothing.

148. novalia, tlte growing orop.

151. venales iecerit: ie. has
brought into the market. It does
not follow from this that there
were not strict laws among the
Romans for the punishment of
such injuries, but the poor farmer
is at a great disadvantage if he
attempts to settle a dispute with a
rich and powerful neighbor by

legal process, and he naturally
prefers to submit to imposition;
cf. Hor. C. 11. 18. 23-28 quid quod
usque proximos revellis agri ter-
minos et ultra limites clientium
salis avarus? pellitur paraenesin
sinu sereres deos et uxor et oir
sordidosque notos.

152. sed qui sermones: cl.
10. 88 lri sermones tunc de Ser'auo .·
but, you say, public opinion will
condemn the rich man for this
base treatment oi a weak neigh-
bor. He replies: ‘Public opinion
cannot harm me. 1 do not desire
the good opinion of my neighbors
if Ι must be poor in order to gain
it.'

¹53· tunicam malo lupini
quam, J would rather hooc α beau
pod tlron, like our ‘I don't care a
straw for '; ci. Stat. Silo. IV. 9. 5ο
bulborum lum'cae.

155. paucissima farra, a scanty
crop ofspell.

156. scilicet, of course, intro·
ducing an ironical sentence.
