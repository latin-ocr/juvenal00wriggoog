SATVRA XIV

qualibet. illa tuo sententia semper in ore

versetur dis atque ipso Iove digna poeta:

unde habeas quaerit· nemo, sed oportet habere.

hoc monstrant vetulae pueris repentibus assae,

hoc discunt omnes ante alpha et beta puellae’

talibus instantem monitis quemcumque parentem 210
sic possem adfari: ‘dic, o vanissime, quis te

festinare iubet? meliorem praesto magistro

discipulum. securus abi: vinceris ut Aiax

praeteriit Telamonem, ut Pelea vicit Achilles,
parcendum est teneris, nondum implevere medullas εις
maturae mala nequitiae. cum pectere barbam

coeperit et longi mucronem admittere cultri,

falsus erit testis, vendet periuria summa

exigua et Cereris tangens aramque pedemque.

in vs. 207, of unknown origin, but
which, the father says, is good
enough to have been written by
Jove himself.-in ore versetur,
let it be on your lips.

206. dis: see lntr. 87.

²07· unde habeas, etc: cf. Sen.
Ep. 115. 14 nou quare et unde,
quid habeas tantum rogant.

208. repentibus: tle. not yet

212. festinare: sc. to fill your

²¹3· vinceris: as Ajax and
Achilles surpassed their fathers in
bravery, so your son will surpass
you iu avarice.

²15· parcendum est teneris,
you must sparo the young, the
direction of Vergil (Geor. ll. 363)
about the care of the young vines.
Do not expect too much of your

son when very young. Fullyde·
veloped wickedness comes only
with time. In a few years he will
not shrink irom anycrime to which
avarice prompts him.

216. maturae mala nequitiae
seems to be required by the con-
nection of thought. Biicheler puts
a colon after medullas aud re-
tains the reading of P. oratura(
mala nequitia est, tlre meaning of
which is not clear; naturae, found
in nearly all MSS, may have arisen
from the error of a copyist.

217. longi cultri = novaculae.

218. summa exigua, sor a tri-
fliug brr'be.

219. et, even. Ceres was hon·
ored at the Eleusinian Mysteries,
and an oath by her, as by the
mystic Cabiri (3. 144), was espe-
cially solemn ; lntr. 3. -tangens
aram (ci. 13. 89): to make the
oath seem more sacred, as one
