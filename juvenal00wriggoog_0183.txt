Xl. ΟΝ P1‚n1uL1vruc.—On
the last day of the Megalesian fes-
tival, April 10, Juvenal invites his
friend Persicus to dine with him.
He describes the plain country
fare at his table, contrasting it
with the wanton luxury at the
dinners of the rich, and inciden-
tally gives a pleasing picture of the
simple lile of the Romans in the
early days. To this he prefixes an
introduction (1-55) on the foolish-
neas ot tl ho spends on

his appetite more than his re·
sources allow.

1-55. One should live accord-
ing to his means and know what
he can afford. By borrowing and
dissipation men are driven to vol·
untary exile to escape their credit-
