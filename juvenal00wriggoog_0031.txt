can be clearly separated from that of P. Moreover‚ all
the MSS. (except some that are still more incompleta)
stop abruptly in the middle of a sentence with verse 60
of Satire 16. Therefore all existing MSS. must have come
from one imperfect original which ended with that verse.

22. There are other important sources for portions of
the text. The Schedac Araviensen or Aarau Fragments,l con·
sist oi five leaves which were rescued from the covers of
manuscript rolls in the library of the town of Aarau in
Switzerland‚ where they are still kept. They contain about
425 verses from Satires 2, 3, 6, and 7. The codex from
which they were taken belonged to the same recension as
P, and closely resembled that MS. in external appearance.
So iar as preserved, each page of the Aarau Fragments
agrees throughout with the corresponding page of P, con·
taining precisely the same verses and the same scholia.

The Bobbio Palimpsest‚¹ No. 5750 in the Vatican
library, consists of two leaves from a very old codex oi
Juvenal and Persius. lt contains fifty-two verses of Juvenal
(14. 323-15. 43), with several scholia, and fifty-two verses
of Persius (1. 53-104). By this fragment the reading of
Α P at 15. 27, Iunco, is confirmed.

The Florilegium Sangallense,³ No. 870 in the abbey
library of St. Gall in Switzerland‚ contains 282 verses
from Juvenal. This furnishes the new reading at 8.148‚
mulio consul, which has been accepted by Biicheler and
Mayor.

23. There are two sets of scholia. The scholia handed
down in the inferior MSS. bear the name ol Cornutus
These are very full, but they contain little that is of much
