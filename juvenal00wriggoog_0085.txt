ille metit barbam, crinem hic deponit amati;
plena domus libis vena¹rbus; accipe et istud
fermentum tibi habe: praestare tributa clientes
cogimur et cultis augere peculia servis. ’

Quis timet aut timuit gelida Praeneste ruinam 190 ·
aut positis nemorosa inter iuga Volsiniis aut
simplicibus Gabiis aut proni Tiburis arde?
nos urbem colimus tenui tibicine fultam
magna parte sui; nam sic labentibus obstat
vilicus et veteris rimae cum texit hiatum,
securos pendente iubet dormire ruina.

186. metit barbam : the day on

which the heard of a Roman was

On such an occasion the clients
are expected to be present.
’ 187. libis: sacrificial cakeS,
which are provided for all the
guests. 'l‘o refuse one would be
discourtesy; but the slaves ex-
pect a tip (venalibus). For the
ablative, see Intr. 35.—accipe:
salibam.

188. fermentum: as leaven to
help you digest it.

rum. The poorer classes at Rome
lived in tenement houses called
insulae, about the construction of
which we have scanty informa-
tion. They were carried up to
a great height (vs. 269n)‚ were
often cheaply built, and rendered
still more insecure by the neglect
of necessary repairs. The falling
of such buildings was a constant
source oi danger.
