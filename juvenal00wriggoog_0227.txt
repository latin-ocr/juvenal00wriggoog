SATVRA XIV

Plurima sunt, Fuscine, et iam'a, digna sinistrh

et nitidis maculam haesuram figentia rebuslll

quae monstrant ipsi pueris traduntque parentes.

si damnosa senem iuvat alea, ludit et heres

bullatus parvoque eadem movet arma fritillo. 5
nec melius de se cuiquam sperare propinquo

concedet iuveniS, qui radere tubera terrae,

boletum condire et eodehhhie natantis

mergere ficedulas didicit nebulone parente
et cana monstrante gula. cum septimus annus ιο

XIV. Ow Tira Taarrrrwo or
Chironem- This satire is di-
rected against the corruptinginflu-
ence of the example of vicious
parents upon their children. More
than half of it is devoted to avarice
and to the crimes which men com-
mit and the dangers to which they
expose themselves in order to gain
wealth.

1-58. Children learn many vices
from their parents; therefore every-
thing that is corrupting should be
banished from the home. Your
son will resemble you, not only in
face, but in character, and you may
some day disinherit him for being
just what your influence has made
him.
