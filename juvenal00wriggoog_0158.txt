SATVRA X

Omnibus in terris quae sunt a Gadibus usque
Auroram et Gangen pauci dinoscere possunt

vera bona atque illis multum diversa, remota ’
erroris nebula quid enim ratione timemus

aut cupimus? quid tarn dextro pede concipis ut te · 5

evertere domos totas optantibus ip‘sis

273. asylo: ef. Liv. 1. 8.

275. quod dicere nolo: Plu·
tarch (Rom. 9) says that slaves,
debtors, and murderers took
refuge in the asylum.

gIory, long life, and personal
beauty have often proved fatal
gifts. The conclusion, then, is that
he is wisest who pras only for
health and virtue, an leaves it to

they deem best. Juvenal was
closely followed by Dr. Johnson

1. Gadibus: (modern Cadiz)

situated on an island beyond the
Strait of Gibraltar, often put for
the extreme limit of the known
world on the west. —usquez
often used without ad before the.
accusative of names of towns ; with
the accusative of other names of
localities it occurs first in Livy
XLIV. 5. 6, and is found occa·

3. illis: dative with diversa
(Intr. 3o); cf. Hor. Ep. 1. 18. 5. —

4. quid enirn: Intr. 78.

5. tam dextro pede: i.e. so aus·
piciously. To set out with the left
foot first was considered unlucky.
Vitnrvius (III. 3. 4) says temples
should be built with an odd num·
ber of steps, so that one might put
the right foot on the first step, and
also enter the temple with the
same foot forward.

7. optantibus ipsis: i.e. in an·
