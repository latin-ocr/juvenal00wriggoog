66 IVVENALIS

gaudebit nido, viridem thoraca iubebit

adferri minimasque nuces assemque rogatum,

ad mensam quotiens parasitus venerit infans.
Vilibus ancipites iungi ponentur amicis,

boletus domino, sed quales Claudius edit

ante illum uxoris, post quem nihil amplius edit.
Virro sibiet reliquis Virronibus illa iubebit

poma dari, quorum solo pascaris odore,

qualia perpetuus Phaeacum autumnus habebat,

credere quae possis subrepta sororibus Afris:

tu scabie frueris mali, quod in aggere rodit
