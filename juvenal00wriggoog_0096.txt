76. abolla : cf. 3. 11 5 n; here the
military cloalc which the praefectus
urbi wore as commander of the
cohortes urbanae.

77. Pegasus: the pracy‘ectus
urbi. -vilicusz Domitian regard-
ed Rome as his estate, and the
prefect was like a slave under the
order of amaster. According to
the scholiast, Pegasus was the son
of a captain of a· trireme, and re-
ceived his name from the figure-
head upon his father's ship.

79. interpres legum: Pegasus
was a prominent jurist-quam-
quam temporibus: Intr. 42.

80. inermi iustitia: his treat-
ment οἱ offenders was mild, though
it was a time when the severest
measures were demanded.

8r. Crispi iucunda senectus:
Intr. 60. Vibius Crispus, now
eighty years oi age (vs. 92), was
once the ioremost pleader of his
time, and had gained such a for·
tune by his eloquence that his
wealth was proverbial (Mart. 1v.
54. 7 divitior Crispo). He had
been one of the amici of Vespasian

(Tac. Dial. 8). It was Crispus
who made the well-known reply to
a person inquiring whether any-1
one was with Domitian, ne musca
quidem (Suet. Dom. 3).

82. mite ingenium: in apposi-
tion with Crispi senectus, but
implying, from its position, that
his character and his eloquence
alike lacked strength and vigor;
cf. Quint. X. 1. 119 Vibius Crispus
compositus et iucundus et delecta·
tiom' natus.

84. comes: not identical with
amicus. For each expedition of
the emperor outside oi Italy' comi·
tes were selected from the list of
the amici. Friedl'ander Ι.5 121.-
clade et peste: i.e. Domitiam
the misiortune ior the author oi
it; Intr. 79 c. ⁴

86. violentius, more irritabit, ’
more ready to take offeme. It was
not saie for Domitian’s friends'to
disagree with him, even about the
state of the weather.

87. cum quo: Intr. 48. On
spondaic verses, see Intr. 83.

88. locuturi: see Intr. 41 α. χ
