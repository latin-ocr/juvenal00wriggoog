et Catulus, maneant qui nigrum in candida vertunt, 30
quis facile est aedem conducere flumina portus
siccandam eluviem, portandum ad busta cadaver,

et praebere caput domina venale sub hasta.

quondam hi cornicines et municipalis harenae

perpetui comites notaeque per oppida buccae, 35
munera nunc edunt et verso pollice vulgus

31. quis = quibus. — facile
est: is. they have no scruple
about ; cf. rr. 17 lsazsd difficile est.
They are quite willing to take con·
tracts to build or repair temples‚
to collect the river and harbor dues,
to cleanse the sewers, or to con-
duct funerals‚ and then to go into
bankruptcy in order to deiraud
the state.

33. praebere caput venale, to
be sold up, sle. to have their goods
seized and sold for the benefit of
their cr'editors. Having taken the
contracts and given security by
pledging their goods‚ they em·
bezzle the money received from
the state and become bankrupt
after putting the greater part oi
their property beyond the reach
oi the law. What is left is sold
sub hasta. Another interpretation
of praebere caput venale is to

auction‚ called domina because it
conferred on the purchaser dms·-
ns'um, or righttui ownership.
