enee of histriones in securing appointments in the army,
composed against Paris, an actor. According to the atita
of the cordos pithoeanus these verses were not at first pub-
lished, but being afterwards inserted in his writings (7. 90-
92) they were thought to be directed against an actor ol the ,’
day whose friends were receiving promotion, and in conse· ²
quence Juvenal was sent at the age ol eighty, under the form
of a military command, to the extremity of Egypt, where he
soon died. Upon what foundation any part of this story rests,
it is impossible to say. It must have been well known in the
fifth century, since Sidonius Apollinaris, a Christian writer
of that time, thought Juvenal sufficiently described hythe
expression “r'rati ln'strr'om's exsul.” Paris, on whom th
verses are said to have been written, was a celebrated actoJ
under Domitian, and died in 83. As Satire 7 was pub ·
lished in Hadrian’s reign, the actor who is said to have
been offended hy them at the time ol their publication
must have lived in the reign oi that emperor, and follow·
ing this account we must believe that Juvenal in his old
age was sent to a remote military post as prefect of a
cohort by Hadrian. An emperor who banished for his
sarcastic criticism and afterwards put to death the archi·
tect who had built Trajan’s forum, may have banished
Juvenal for a slight offense given even in asatire which
begins with a flattering compliment to himself, but it is
highly improbable that a man too old for service should
have been intrusted with an important military command.
If the banishment took this form, it is far more likely thatyJ
it occurred under Domitian, and 1t has been suggested thatJJ
Juvenals bitterness against Crispinus would be explainedJ

The whole story does not seem like an invention. There
is nothing in the satires to have suggested it, though the
statement that he was sent to Egypt may have been an
