PREFACE

Tin: text of this edition is substantially that of Biicheler
(1893), but changes have been made freely in punctuation
and orthography. Deviations from Biicheler’s text which
affect the meaning are noticed in the Critical Appendix.

In the text edition will be found all that has come down
to us from Juvenal, including the new verses of Satire 6 dis-
covered in 1899 by Mr. Winstedt in the Bodleian Library. It
did not seem best to include in the annotated edition Satires

a, 6, and 9, which from the nature of their subjects are not gen-
erally read with undergraduate students. Some of the read-
² ings ol the Bodleian MS. are noticed in the Critical Appendix.

While this MS. corresponds in general with the ω class, it not
infrequently retains the readings ol the Codex Pithoeanus, and
in a few cases may alone have preserved a correct tradition.

The commentary owes much to the editions of Heinrich,
Mayor, Lewis, Friedldnder, and Duff, also to Friedliinder's
Sittengesclticltte, and his edition of Martial. In preparing
that partos the Introduction which treats of language and
style, important help has also been received from Kiaer,
and from the dissertations of Weise and of Lupus.

I am under obligations to Professor Morris of Yale lor
many suggestions regarding syntax, to Mr. Winstedt ol
Oxlord lor readings of the Bodleian MS, and especially to
the Editors ot the Series for their uniform patience and
lorinvaluable assistance in every part ol the work.
