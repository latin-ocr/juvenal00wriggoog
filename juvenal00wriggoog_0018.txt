LIFE AND WRITINGS

Souncus

1. We have very little trustworthy information about
Juvenal. The only sources from which any facts oi his
lile can be derived are: (1) the ancient biographies; (2)
a dedicatory inscription; (3) three epigrams of Martial;
and (4) a few passages in his own writings. ⁶

2. Numerous lives oi Juvenal (vitae)¹ are preserved in
the manuscripts, at the beginning or end. These are not
independent biographies but have all corne from one origi· ’
nal, the best representative oi which is theone found on
an added leaf at the end of the codex pithoeanus, and writ-
ten by a later hand.² These vitae generally agree that
Juvenal was born at Aquinum, that he was the son or
foster-son ot a wealthy freedman, that he practised decla·
mation till about middle life, and that he was banished in
consequence of offense given to an actor by some verses
now contained in Satire 7. They differ chiefly as to the
time and place of his banishment, aud the circumstances
of his death. The statements regarding his birthplace, his
rhetorical studies and the position oi his father are not
inconsistent with anything found in the satires, and have
probably been derived from a reliable source.
