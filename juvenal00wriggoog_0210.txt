SATVRA XIII

iudice nemo nocens absolvitur, improba quamvis
gratia fallaci praetoris vic‘erit urna.

quid sentire putas omnes, Calvine, recenti

de scelere et fidei violatae crimine? sed nec

tam tenuis census tibi contigit ut mediocris
iacturae te mergat onus, nec rara videmus

quac pateris; casus multis hic cognitus ac iam
tritus et e medio fortunae ductus acervo. ,
ponamus nimios gemitus. flagrantior aequo ,ὲ

non debet dolor esse viri nec vulnere maior.

tu quamvis levium minimam exiguamque malorum
particulam vix ferre potes, spumantibus ardens
visceribus, sacrum tibi quod non reddat amicus 15
depositum? stupet haec qui iam post terga reliquit
sexaginta annos Fonteio consule natus?

4. praetoris urna: the urn into
which the ballots of the iudices
were cast. Itis fallax, since it
gives an unjust verdict‚ either
because a false return of the votes
has been made by the praetor, or
because he has influenced the
iudices to make a wrong decision.
Each iudex was given three tab-
lets‚ inscribed with A (absolvo), c
(condemno), N. L. (non liquet),
respectively‚ one oi which he east
into the urm-vicerit: Intr. 43.

5. sentire, feel. Juvenal makes
tour suggestions calculated to af-
ford Calvinussome comfort: (1)the
man's conscience condemns hirn;
(2) you bave the sympathy of
everybody; (3) your income is such
that you can stand the loss; and
(4) your misfortnne is one that is
common.

8. iacturae, loss ; the throwing
overboard of apert oi the cargo to
save the ship3 ef. vs. 177, and 3.
125 n.

10. tritusz an everyday affair.
—e medio acervo: ia. it is only
an ordinary misiortune‚ not one
selected especially for you.

11. flagrantior aequo, more in-
tense than is reasonable ,· cf. 11. 88.

12. viri : i.e. oi one worthy to be
called a man. —vulnere maior:
i.e. out of proportion'to the loss.

14. spumantibus ardens vi-
secribus,w1'thvitals hotondfoam-
ing ; cf. 1. 45 siccum iecur ardeat
tra.

15. sacrum: because received
under oath and in the presence oi
a deity.

17. Fonteio consule: L. Fon·
teius Capito, consul in nn. 67. 11
Calvinus, now over 60, was born
in his consulship, the satire was
written not earlier than 127 (lutr.
5). Another Fonteius Capito was
consul in nn. 59, but heis named
in the Fasti after his colleague‚ and
his name alone would not therefore
be taken to designate the year.
