IVVENALIS

quo loquor, egregium populus putat adquirendi 1
artificem ; quippe his crescunt patrimonia fabriS,

sed crescunt quocumque modo, maioraque fiunt
incude adsidua semperque ardente camino

et pater ergo animi felices credit avar0s;

inbuit et cogit minimas ediscere sordes;

mox adquirendi docet insatiabile votum. 1
servorum ventres modio castigat iniquo

126. modio iniquo: cf. Liv.
