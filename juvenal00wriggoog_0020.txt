of Domitian in 96 (4. 153), and of the trial of Marius Priscus
in 1oo (1. 49). It represents society as it existed under
Domitian, and many of the illustrations are· taken from
that period, but it does not follow that any of the satires
of this book were written during the lifetimef of that .
emperor, and ‘chamaeleonum u9t have been published⁴
before 100. It pr9bably was not finished till several
yeQshja‘tdateas no reason is known for assuming
any considerable' rnt terval between Books Ι and ΙΙ. Book
II (Satire 6) was not published before 116. Friedldnder
has proved that the comet that forboded destruction to
the Armenian and Parthian kings (vs. 443) was one
visible at Rome in November 115, and the victories of
Trajan over the Armenians and Parthians, said to have

7-9) appeared in the early years of the reign of Hadrian,
whose praise is celebrated in the beginning of Satire 7,
and evidently before 121, when the emperor set out from
Rome to make his journey through the provinces. The
mention in 8. 120 of Marius Priscus as having lately robbed
the province of Africa does not necessarily show that this
satire was written before the publication of Book Il, asa
man already nearly sixty could easily use nuper of an event
that had occurred from eighteen to twenty years earlier. Two
passages in Book V (Satires 13-16) fix its date after the
year 127. In 13. 16-17 Calvinus now sixty years old, is
said to have been born in the consulship of Fonteius, i.e. of
Fonteius Capito, consul in 67. Again, the events described
in Satire 15 are said (vs. ²7) to have been enacted lately
in the consulship of Juncus, rie. oi Aemilius Juncus, consul
in 127. There is nothing in Book IV (Satires 10-12) to
determine its date, but it was probably produced between
