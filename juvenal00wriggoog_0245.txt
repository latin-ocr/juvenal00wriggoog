ocius Archigenen quaere atque erne quod Mithridates y

composuit ; si vis aliam decerpere ficum

atque alias tractare rosas, medicamen habendum est,

Monstro voluptatem egregiam, cui nulla theatra,

nulla aequare queas praetoris pulpita lauti,

si spectes quanto capitis discrimine constent

incrementa domus, aerata multus in arca

ex quo Mars Vltor galeam quoque perdidit et res

non potuit servare suas. ergo omnia Florae

(NH. VII. 153lqu0tes a statement
of Hesiod, not elsewhere found,
that the liie of the stag is four
times that of the crow, and the
life of the crow nine times that of
man. The supposition that the
stag is long-lived is erroneous.

252. Archigenen: acelebrated
physician at Rome in the reign of
'l'rajan; 13. 98.—quod Mithri-
dates composuit :ch Plin. Ν. H.
xxix. 2411l1'tl2ridan'um antidotum
ex rebus Llsll componitur. He
took so many antidotes that when,
at last, he tried to end his life by
taking poison, it had no effect
(Aul. Gell. XVll. 16).

253· aliam . . . rosas: i.e. to
live another year. For fresh roses
and ripe figs as marking respec-
tively the coming of spring and
autumn, ci. Cic. Vcrr. ll. 5. 27,
and Hor. Ep. l. 7. 5.

255. etpater et rex:the father's
life is as much in danger irom his
son, who is in haste to possess his
property, as the king's from those
who wish to deprive him of his
throne.

260. fiscus: under the empire
this word is generally used to de
note that part of the public revenue
which belongs to the emperor, as
in 4. 55. Here it is the private
property oi any individual—vi·
gilem: because a guard was sra-
tioned there. The temple of Cas-
tor and Pollux was in the iorum
Romanum, and near this were the
shops of the bankers (argerrtariil.
Three Corinthian columns oi this
temple are still standing. The
depositor left his money with a
banker, who deposited it in a neigh-
boring temple ior safe keeping;
cf. 8. 142 n. lt appears from this
passage that the temple oi Mars
Vltor, in the forum of Augustus,
had lost the confidence of bank·
ers as a place of saie deposit, be
cause it had once been robbed.
