quaedam cum prima resecentur crimina barba.
indulge veniam pueris: Lateranus ad illos
thermarum calices inscriptaque lintea vadit

amnibus et Rheno atque Histro. praestare Neronem ¹70
securum valet haec aetas. mitte Ostia, Caesar,
mitte, sed in magna legatum quaere popina;
invenies aliquo cum percussore iacentem,
permixtum nautis et furibus ac fugitivis, '
inter carnifices et fabros sandapilarum

et resupinati cessantia tympana galli.

aequa ibi libertas, communia pocula, lectus

non alius cuiquam, nec mensa remotior ulli.'
