SATVRA XIV

et spoliare doces et circumscribere et omni

crimine divitias adquirere, quarum amor in te

quantus crat patriae Deciorum in pectore, quantum
dilexit Thebas, si Graecia vera, Menoeceus, 240
in quorum sulcis legiones dentibus anguis

cum clipeis nascuntur et horrida bella capessunt
continuo, tamquam et tubicen surrexerit una.

ergo ignem, cuius scintillas ipse dedisti,

flagrantem late et rapientem cuncta videbis. ²45
nec tibi parcetur misero, trepidumque magistrum

in cavea magno fremitu leo tollet alumnus.

nota mathematicis genesis tua, sed grave tardas
exspectare c-olqs3 morieris stamine nondum

abrupto. iam nunc obstas et vota moraris, 250
iam torquet iuvenem longa et cervina senectus.

237. circumscribere, to de·
fraud ,· 10. 2223 15. 136 circum·
scriptorem.

²39· Deciorum: the Decii (8.
2 54 n) died to save the honor of
their country ; the miser risks life
to save his money.

240. si Graecia vera: cf. 10. 174
quidquid Grdrcia mendax audet in
historin—Menoeceus, son ot
Creon, in the war of the Seven
against Thebes, slew himself when
Tiresias had prophesied that the
Thebans would conquer if the last
of the race of Cadmus should
willingly suffer death to ›appease
Mars for the slaying of the dragon.
Verses 241-243 confirm the doubt
expressed in si Graecia vera, te.
if we are to believe the stories of
a people who affirm as true that
which is impossible, as that legions
of armed men once sprang from
the soil.

241. quorum: the antecedent
is implied in Thebas. The story

of the sparti, and of their combat
with one another, is found in Ov.
Met. Ill.1o4-13o.

244. ergo carries us back to
the sentence ending with omni
crimine divitias adquirere (vs.
238), before the examples of the
Decii and Menoeceus were intro-
duced.

247. leo alumnus: Intr. 56.
Your son will get rid of you as the
trained lion dispatched his keeper
in the cage; cf. Mart. Spect. ιο. 1
laeserat ingrato leo perfidus ore
magistrum.

248. mathematicis, astrolqgrru
cf. 3. 43; ro. 94. Your nativity
has been calculated by them, you
say, and they have foretold a long
life. He cannot wait for the fates,
but will take you off by poison.—
grave, burdensome.

249. colus, stamine: cf. 3. ²73
ιο. 252; 11. 69n; 12„ 65 n.

250. vota, his wishes.

251. cervina senectus: Pliny
