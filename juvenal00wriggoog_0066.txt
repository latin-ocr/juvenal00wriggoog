oi Apollo stood in the forum of
Augustus (Plin. NsH. Vll. 183),

sumptuously and without guests.

128. sportula: the first two
hours of the day were devoted to
the salutatio ,¹ Mart. IV. 8. 1 pri-

it appears that the sportula was
, given in connection with the salu-
tatio, probably just after it. But
¹ Martial, in III. 7. 3and X. 70. 13
(written several years earlier),
speaks oi receiving it in the after·

There is no real inconsistency in
’ these statements. lt is not neces-
sary to assume that, at any time,
all patrous followed exactly the
same plan regarding the distribu-
tion οἱ the sportula, or that the
prevailing practice did not change
from time to time-deinde: af-

Statues ol distinguished Roman
generals were set up in this forum
by Augustus (Suet. Aug. 31), and

in the midst of them now stands

thestatue of some Egyptian officer.
Both Mayor and Friedldnder think
that this was Tiberius Julius Alex-
ander, who, as prefect of Egypt,
was the first to proclaim Vespasian
emperor, mn. 69, and was general-
in·chief under Titus at the siege of
Jerusalem. Itis not improbable
that his statue was placed in the
forum oi Augustus. He was an
able officer, but Juvenal speaks of
him with contempt because he was
an Egyptian.

money given them as sportula.
