x INTRODUCTION

3. Α tablet1 dedicated to Ceres by some person whose
name was Juvenal was found at Aquinum. The original
stone is now lost, and the inscription, defective ιιι some
parts, is preserved by copies only. As the praenomen of
the person who made the dedication is wanting, it is uncer-
tain whether the tablet was put up by the poet or by some
other member of his family. But as it was discovered at
Aquinum, which Juvenal often visited (3. 319), and was
consecrated to Ceres, whom he honored (3. 3²0) and every-
where speaks of with respect (14. ²¹9³ 15. 141), and that '
evidently not long after the death of Vespasian3 and more
over since the tablet contains nothing that contradicts what
is known about Juvenal from other sources, it is a reasonable ”
inference that the Juvenal of the inscription is the poet. If
this be admitted, we learn from this source that, at the time

ι when the dedication was made, Juvenal had served as tribune

J of a Dalmatian cohort, had been duumvir quinquennalis at

pl Aquinum, and was flamen of the deified Vespasian.

. ’ 4. The references to Juvenal in the epigrams of Martial'
show that the two poets were friends, and that in or shortly
before the years 9² and 101 Juvenal was living in Rome,
where at the latter date he was busily engaged in the weari-
some duties of a client. Martial (VII. 91. 1) calls him facunss
dus, an epithet probably given to him in recognition oi his
rhetorical skill, since it is unlikely that he had become
known as a poet four years before the death of Domitian.

5. From his own writings the period to which his literary
career belongs can be approximately fixed. The sixteen
satires are divided into five books, and it is quite certain
that the books are arranged in the order of their publica·

J tion. Book I (Satires 15) contains mention of the con-
iquest of the Orcades by Agricola 1n 84 (2.161),of the death
